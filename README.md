# Predicting car prices with the k-nearest neighbors algorithm

This analysis uses car feature data and past prices to make recommendations on how to price cars. It currently uses scikit-learn's KNearestNeighbors model on an 80/20 train/test validation set. From this analysis it is found which features are the best at predicting car prices, how many features to use to get the best model, and what is the optimal k value.

This project is currently in progress.
